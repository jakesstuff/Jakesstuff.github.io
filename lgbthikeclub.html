            <h1>Queer Hiking Club</h1>
            <a href="https://www.heylo.com/g/215f9747-7d13-46fa-8314-560777352385" target="_blank" class="youtube">Heylo Club Page</a>
            <p>Sometimes it can feel unsafe to explore the great outdoors as a queer person. This group is designed to be a supportive, safe, and semi-private community to make new connections. We are a new social group looking for LGBTQIA+ folks to help it grow and make new community connections in Northern Colorado.</p>
            <p>There are scheduled two-three hikes each month. See the bottom of this description for this month's "intro hike" where newbies are invited to come and introduce themselves to the group before being given access to the page. Other hikes and information is kept inside the group for members only.</p>
            <p>At least one club leader will be at every hike.</p>
            <h3>Code of Conduct / Rules</h3>
            <p>1. Anyone who identifies as part of LGBTQIA+ is welcome here. If you think certain letters don't belong, then you don't belong in this group.</p>
            <p>2. This is a safe space. As such, republicans and police are not welcome in this group, for these are groups that have historically and continue to be enemies of queer diversity.</p>
            <p>3. Respect is expected. Racism, discrimination, and harassment will not be tolerated. If you are having issues with a member, please report it to a group leader.</p>
            <h3>How To Join</h3>
            <p>1 -- ***Fill out the google forms link below. This gives the club leaders the ability to vet people wanting to join so this can continue to be a safe and secure place.</p>
            <p>2 -- Request to join here within the Heylo portal. Club leaders will compare the google forms info to your Heylo account to know who it is that is wanting to join. Please make sure the names match.</p>
            <p>***In regards to the google form: If you have been invited to join by a pre-existing member of the group, reference the "Secret Code" that your friend gave you! If you are attending one of the monthly intro-hikes, the group members on that hike will be vetting you to make sure you are safe for the group. Ask one of them for the "Secret Code" !!ONLY!! at the END of the hike. (having the "Secret Code" ensures you are already connected to the group in real life, and is the 100% best way to join the group. Otherwise, the more info you can provide the google form the better!)</p>
            <h3>APPLICATION GOOGLE FORM</h3>
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqlGEpCGW5ls53JuR25douCo45zzgehKWPPdQFNzJ_tTKUBQ/viewform?edit2=2_ABaOnudt3PuWa17QpVhdgLrQ0O37XXWuirRiZLaOXusOvOOz7mu9s3z_T_wfR8fLUEMqp68" target="_blank" class="youtube">Google Form Application</a>
            <p>Please allow up to 7-days to process your join request :)</p>
