            <p>This group celebrates human diversity in all it's forms. If you identify as queer or LGBT+, you are welcome in this group.<b>*</b></p>
            <p><b>*</b>If you're transphobic, you are not welcome in this group. If you support the republican party that actively works to attack our community, you are not welcome. If you are a police officer, an occupation that exists to oppress human freedom, you are not welcome.</p>
            <p>To protect our members, most event info is not publicly available.
