            <h1>Hi, my name is Jake! (he/him)</h1>
            <p>I'm a goofy human and I do stuff. I want to show off some of the things that I do.</p>
            <p>I enjoy being outdoors. I like to hike and camp, and I bike, more so road commuting. I car camp often on trips. I enjoy rock climbing, but after moving I haven't gone very often after missing the large gym I was accustom to.</p>
            <p>I enjoy travelling (don't we all) and make an effort to go to new places and experience new things. I walk a lot versus taxis to see the most I can. I've been to Mexico, Ecuador, Italy, and briefly Canada. Domestically, I take roadtrips focusing on native history. As much as I can, I put all my plans on paper to avoid using a phone. If I get lost, I ask the gas station attendant or whoever else is around.</p>
            <p>I don't watch a lot of TV, and when I do it's usually pre-2009 Star Trek. Babylon 5 is my favorite Sci-Fi series.</p>
            <p>I like to use my typewriter and paint when the mood strikes me. I mostly listen to music on CDs because it's got the reality of a record, but the portability of an MP3. Kinda!</p>
            <p>Thanks for reading :)</p>
