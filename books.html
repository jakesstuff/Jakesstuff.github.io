            <h3><u>Monday The Rabbi Took Off</u> by Harry Kemelman (1972)</h3>
            <p>Review written 12/21/2025</p>
            <img src="images/mondaytherabbibook.jpg" alt="mondaytherabbibook" width="215" height="286">
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<u>Monday The Rabbi Takes Off</u> is the third in a series of mystery books starring the Rabbi David Small. It is very understandable as a stand-alone story and often I found myself forgetting that there was a backstory to it. Small takes a sabbatical to visit Israel, a place he has never been, as he contemplates his future: does he want to remain a rabbi to his loyal congregation, or retire to devote himself to personal research and relaxation. The story takes place in the present time, which in 1972 was only 5 years after the Six-Day War, and just 24 years after the founding of Israel. The people that Small encounters are proud of Israel’s accomplishments. About halfway through the book, there is an explosion, and that is what the “mystery” revolves around.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Putting aside that this is intended to be a mystery novel, the primary conflict is within David Small himself and his self-discovery. Most of the story revolves him moving around parts of Israel, and that is what makes the book intriguing. The reader gets a glimpse of what it was like living in Israel at the time, and primarily in Jerusalem, from a Jewish Israeli point of view. Observations are made of new versus old construction, and of the informal nature of a new nation, particularly demonstrated when Small needs to rent a car and his local friend essentially tells him: Talk to so-and-so, and you get what he gives you when he finds one. Small is assisted by a relative of his wife, who, through her connections, get’s them housing for their short stay, and more. The book emphasizes a strong, “it’s not what you know, it’s who you know” culture.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Alternating with Rabbi Small’s adventure, is the office politics of his congregation back home as they debate replacing him with a more “hip” and experienced Rabbi that the group has quickly grown fond of.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The “C-Plot” of the book, is the mystery itself. The elements of anti-Arab racism are prevalent in this plot line.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The American-born son of a friend of Small’s is studying in Israel, and his father treats him with suspicion and concern that he dares to have friends who are Arab. The son is portrayed as a liberal, Americanized idealist who is superficially critical of Israel. I say superficial, because his complaints are not that Israel is a colonial state, but rather that the government is ineffective in it’s management, for example taking care of its homeless (which his father easily refutes by saying all nations have issues). He is tricked by his close Arabic friend into collaborating with his escape after an explosion. The son serves no purpose to the story other than being a stand in for the typical reading audience, Americans at home, blissfully unaware.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It must be emphasized what I said above. This book is fascinating from a Jewish Israeli point of view. However, Kemelman sanitizes the conflict of the time, and intentionally flattens the characters and motivations involved in the explosion. The characters refer to all non-Jewish citizens as only as Arabs, relying on stereotypes and generalizations to make a clear good-versus-bad dynamic, despite the occasional attempts at depth. There is a brief debate near the end of the book between Rabbi Small and a few other characters that insist that only Jewish speakers of Hebrew are “true Israelis”, and Small pushes back that “anyone who is an Israeli citizen is an Israeli”. Nevertheless, the author makes it clear in this discussion that only Jewish Israelis have any interest in making Israel a home, and names several examples of wrong-doings done by outsiders throughout the country that won’t assimilate to the dominant colonial culture.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Ultimately, I did enjoy the book, but I don’t think most would. It’s a very slow burn, and the mystery portion of it is very dull ultimately. If you’re interested in seeing a romanticized “real life” of being Jewish in Israel in the early 70s, that would be it’s only redeeming aspect.</p>
